# Windows-x64-Processes-Injector


* Shellcode Title:  Windows/x64 - Inject All Processes with Meterpreter Reverse Shell (655 Bytes)
* Tested on:        Windows 10 v2004 (x64)
* Compiled from:    Kali Linux (x86_64)
* Shellcode Description:
*   64bit Windows 10 shellcode that injects all processes with Meterpreter reverse shells. The shellcode first resolves the base address of 
*   kernel32.dll dynamically in memory via the Intel GS Register & host processes Process Environment Block (PEB). Then resolves the addresses 
*   for the OpenProcess, VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, and CreateRemoteThread APIs via kernel32.dll's Export Table.
*   Once all API's are resolved the shellcode then attempts to open a handle to other processes using the OpenProcess API via bruteforcing the PIDs.
*   When a handle to a remote process is returned, the shellcode then attempts to allocate writable & executable memory in the remote process using the 
*   VirtualAllocEx API. If successful, the shellcode will then use the WriteProcessMemory API to write the Meterpreter shellcode into the memory of the 
*   remote process. To this point, if everything has returned sucessful, then the CreateRemoteThread API will be executed to create a thread in the remote
*   process that will run the Meterpreter shell within that remote process. The shellcode then continues to bruteforce through more PIDs to launch more
*   Meterpreter shells.
